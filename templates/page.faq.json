Watch this space.<\/p><p>The tube that houses our Better Hair Days Mask is made from sugarcane plastic. It’s made from renewable sources, unlike traditional plastic that relies on finite crude oil. It’s recyclable too, so make sure you rinse out the tube before you stick it in the recycling bin. <\/p><p>Our paper-based packaging is also recyclable.<\/p><p>Our mailers are made from FSC certified paper and are compostable. They can be added to your household compost or the council green bins. They need to be sent to compost facilities because they need to go through a few extra steps before completely breaking down - so make sure to add them to your council green bins. We don’t recommend adding them to your household compost.<\/p>"
