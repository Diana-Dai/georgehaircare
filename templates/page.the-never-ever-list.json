You can't sit with us.<br\/><br\/>Never will you ever find any of these ingredients on a bottle, tube or sachet from George.These are the nasty fillers and nature-wreckers that have flown under the radar for way too long. As long as you have George, you'll never invite these baddies into your bathroom again.<br\/><br\/><strong>SILICONES: <\/strong>OK, let’s get one thing straight. Silicones aren’t harmful in that they don’t affect your physical health. What they are responsible for though is creating something akin to a false layer — the one that leaves your hair feeling nice and smooth but doesn’t actually help your hair in the long run — in fact, it sort of builds up and makes your hair a little manky. The build up is hard to break down which Is pretty annoying, so we're leaving It out.<br\/><br\/><strong>PARABENS:<\/strong> are a preservative used to ensure products can have a long shelf life (like 6+ months). Parabens are often linked to issues like dryness, irritable scalp, making your colour fade way quicker than it should, and hair loss. The super scary thing about parabens is they’ve been found to be linked in cancers and tumours, so best to avoid them.<br\/><strong><br\/>SULPHATES: <\/strong>are what make hygiene and beauty products froth and foam — but unfortunately, beyond the bubbles, they’re bad news. They’re basically a chemical detergent... which explains why our scalps are dry and irritable... which leads to our scalps overcompensating and producing way more oil than it needs to. To get rid of the oil, we feel compelled to wash our hair, thus continuing this icky cycle. You'll get used to the lack of lather, we promise. It'll do you and our waterways good. Promise.<\/p>",
